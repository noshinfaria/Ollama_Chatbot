Fingerprint patterns have been normally \\nused for identification of an individual. Now a days every organization or even may Gov -\\nernment institutes in India, use fingerprint verification to identify everyone uniquely and \\nit also have been used as a biometric modality for gender and age identification. An indi-\\nvidual is their own key; behind this catchy principle biometrics have become an attractive \\nalternative to traditional identification methods such as tokens or passwords (Fernandes \\net\\xa0al. 2013). Current fingerprint matching methods were started in the sixteenth century. \\nIt was Henry Fauld in 1880 who first experimentally proposed the singularity and unique-\\nness of fingerprint. Herschel (Ravindran et\\xa0 al. 2017) added to the establishment of cur -\\nrent fingerprinting identification. In the nineteenth century Sir Francis Galton (McBean \\net\\xa0al. 2014) directed broad investigations and ordered the sorts of fingerprints relying on \\nessential example as loops, whorls and arches. It was Cummins (Ferraz et\\xa0al. 2010) who \\nauthored the expression “Dermatoglyphics (derma ¼ skin, glyphic ¼ bends), to dermal \\nedge arrangements on the digits, of palms and sole and furthermore demonstrated that edge \\ndesign are resolved incompletely by heredity or natural impact which produce pressure and \\nstrain in their development during fetal life. The fingerprint design whorl might be wind-\\ning, oval, roundabout or any assortment of a loop and record for around 30%. Arches are \\nthe basic type up till now uncommon (about 5%). The fingerprint design has edges running \\nfrom one side to the opposite side of the print without having any re-bend. The term com-\\nposite is utilized for mix of type example that doesn’t fit into any of the above characteriza-\\ntion (Azhagiri et\\xa0al. 2018). Till date, analysts or researches have generally used fingerprint \\ndetails as perspectives to build up any individuals uniqueness. The ridge patterns have been \\ncomprehensively classified into five different kinds called as arch, tented arch, whorl, ulnar \\nand radial loop. An individual can have any of the above type in any of the its fingers. All \\nthings considered, dominant part of fingerprints found in populace review shows that 70 \\npercent of the prints are loops, 20–25 percent being whorls though just 5 to 10 percent \\nconsider arch or tented arch patterns or designs (Singh and Majumdar 2015). Some exami-\\nnations done on twins have presumed that monozygotic or indistinguishable twins have \\ncomparable however not indistinguishable examples found.\\nDermatoglyphics as a diagnostic aid used from ancient eras and now it is well estab-\\nlished in number of diseases which have strong hereditary basis and is employed as a \\nmethod for screening for abnormal anomalies. Fingerprint minutiae patterns of ridges are \\ndetermined as unique through the combination of genetic and environment factors. Person \\nidentification using fingerprint algorithms are well sophisticated and are being established \\nall over the world for security and authentication. The fingerprint also used to classify gen-\\nder and age group but very few manual attempts have been made to explore relationship \\nbetween fingerprint patterns with blood group and common clinical diseases like hyperten-\\nsion, type-2 diabetes and arthritis. It will be helpful for anthropologists to predict blood \\ngroup and classify common clinical diseases than conventional pathological techniques \\nfrom the fingerprints those are obtained from mined articles using Deep Learning Tech-\\nniques for early reminder to prevent such common clinical diseases those arises with aging \\nand also crime investigators to minimize the range of the suspects it would be predicted \\nusing Deep Neural Network.

If there is no response, contributor blood with a similar ABO \\nand RhD type can be utilized. It shows that the blood has responded with certain anti-\\nbody and is hence not perfect with blood containing that sort of counteracting agent If the \\nblood doesn’t agglutinate, it demonstrates that blood doesn’t have antigens restricting the \\nextraordinary immune response in the reagent.

The weaknesses of this framework are more odds of human blunders are con-\\nceivable. Only specialists can tell the blood type by observing at the agglutination proce-\\ndure.

So, it may lead to increase sample size and distribution of features required. The \\nlarge datasets of fingerprint images acquired in real operational conditions are, rightly \\nso, secured under data protection regulations that severely restrict the access to these \\ndata, even for research purposes.\\n6  Conclusion\\nThe fingerprints are having immense potential to have an effective method of identification. \\nIn this research, it investigates the problem of blood group identification and analysis of \\ndisease those arises with aging or disease called as lifestyle-based like hypertension, type \\n2-diabetes and arthritis from fingerprint by analyzing their patterns correlation with blood \\ngroup and age of an individual. With the literature review study, it is observed that fingers \\nof an individual are having multiple unique patterns those are need to be extracted with \\ncomputerized method with fingerprints image captured using digital device which allow to \\nfind known association of fingerprints patterns which may enhance the authenticity of the \\nfingerprints in blood group identification and early indication of lifestyle-based diseases of \\nan individual.\\nThe fingerprint used as a traditional, effective, and unique identification method of an \\nindividual, in future it allows researchers to investigate with various diseases other than \\nthose are arised with age but also helps to explore different antibodies or reactive process \\nof human body in several diseases. Also, similar study helps to predict the risk of any kind \\nof diseases in early age of an individual. The analysis and classification of community \\nbased on age, blood group, fingerprint patterns and lifestyle diseases help to tackle any \\npandemic in future like COVID-19 in which mankind may suffer a lot having lifestyle-\\nbased diseases like hypertension, type 2-diabetes.\\nReferences\\nAli MMH, Mahale VH, Yannawar P, Gaikwad AT (2016) Fingerprint recognition for person identification \\nand verification based on minutiae matching.

Fingerprint patterns have been normally \\nused for identification of an individual. Now a days every organization or even may Gov -\\nernment institutes in India, use fingerprint verification to identify everyone uniquely and \\nit also have been used as a biometric modality for gender and age identification. An indi-\\nvidual is their own key; behind this catchy principle biometrics have become an attractive \\nalternative to traditional identification methods such as tokens or passwords (Fernandes \\net\\xa0al. 2013). Current fingerprint matching methods were started in the sixteenth century. \\nIt was Henry Fauld in 1880 who first experimentally proposed the singularity and unique-\\nness of fingerprint.

       "'Thank you for providing the context! Based on the information provided, I can answer your question as follows:\\n\\nFingerprint map reading is a technique used to determine the blood type of an individual based on the patterns found in their fingerprints. The process involves analyzing the ridges and valleys in the fingerprints to determine if there are any specific patterns that indicate a particular blood type.\\n\\nThe study you mentioned in the context, conducted by Pimenta et al. (2012), showed that dermatoglyphics (the study of fingerprints) can be used as an indicative tool for predicting the chance of developing diabetes in the future. However, the study did not investigate the relationship between fingerprint patterns and blood type.\\n\\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the context, it is not possible to determine the blood type of an individual based solely on their fingerprint map reading. The traditional method of determining blood type through agglutination testing is still the most accurate and reliable method. However, the study you mentioned suggests that dermatoglyphics may be used as a tool for predicting the chance of developing diabetes in the future.'"
